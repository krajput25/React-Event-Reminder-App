# Event-Reminder-App

Hey Guys,

This is a simple web application that has been developed using the technologies - HTML, CSS and React JS.
The Event Reminder App can be highly modified  to entertain growing user needs.
This basic application shows you a list of all the events that you need to complete during the day, with the help of data stored in an API,
and gives you an option to clear all the events once you're finished with them. This application serves as a to-do-list as well. 

Here is the deployed version of the same: https://event-reminder-app.netlify.app

Thank you!
